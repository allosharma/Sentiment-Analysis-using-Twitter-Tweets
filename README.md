Sentiment Analysis Model

The project uses twitter data for training the model and based on that training we have come up with a decision model which approximately caculates the sentiments of the people who tweets for the cryptocurrency or related coins.

The project uses liberaries like nltk and tweepy.
We have used Google Colab as our online notebook for machine learning programming and training.

This was the part of a hackathon we did at unified company (Mumbai).
